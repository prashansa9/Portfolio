			<h3>Innovation is Everything</h3>
				
			<p>
				Not every laboratory in the cosmetic industry provides real innovation. To be truly innovative, the experts who create and deliver the products—formulators, marketers, package developers, display manufacturers—must work in perfect unison with the customer. Architectural Beauty takes this concept to new heights, providing levels of innovation rarely seen in the industry.
			</p>

				Our commitment to quality, our insistence on highly personalized service, and our combined experience of more than 100 years in the cosmetics industry means we're not only experts at developing cutting-edge formulations, but also at helping our clients create and grow truly memorable brands. We specialize in finding the perfect balance between innovation and cost of goods, and work tirelessly to meet and exceed our clients' wishes, whether we're providing turn-key or formulation delivery.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our 'Open Development' Platform is one of our greatest secrets to success. We access new technology not typically found in our marketplace and incorporate it into our products. Areas including candy and toy manufacturing, academia, ingredient development and packaging supply all inspire our innovative explorations.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our team is truly passionate about what we do, and our extensive backgrounds in marketing and product development for industry luminaries like L'Oreal, Elizabeth Arden, Estee Lauder, Avon, Max Factor, and Dow Brands means we do it well. At our fully-staffed, 3,000-square foot facility in Paramus, NJ, we eschew politics, eliminate red tape, and focus solely on getting the job done on time and with no attitude.
